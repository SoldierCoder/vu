== Welcome to Voices United

Voices United is a web-application that allows groups of people to send tweets,
through Twitter,over and over again that mention a particular person or target 
-- hopefully to change the target's mind and get them to act the way we want on 
a particular issue.

# Why use Twitter?

Believe it or not I was once a casual user of twitter.  But in advocating for 
people to change their consumer habits so that they don't contribute to **Human Traffficking**, I noticed that one little tweet could get re-sent to a whole slew of people. Like this: ![picture alt](/images/FourteenKRetweet.jpg "Hear me roar!") 

Also, and most importantly, politicians and other people in power monitor and 
respond to what is said in Twitter. Don't take my word for it, ask Emma Sullivan.  She was the high-schooler who got called on the carpet for tweeting to a 
friend, as a joke, that she had “Just made mean comments at gov brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot.” 

Voices United isn't for frivolous communication.  Our aim is to empower people 
help shape real responses to real issues. Like for the sad case of Sara Kruzan.
